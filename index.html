            <header>Hi, I'm Brad</header>
            <div class="about">
                <p>I am a <span>Responsive Web Developer</span> and teacher of high school mathematics and computer science in Oak Park, IL. 
                    When I'm not teaching, coding or coaching basketball, I can be found traveling, exercising and spending time with my fiance, Jill.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-1">
                I was born and raised in Cleveland, and I am an Ohioian to
                my core. I love to travel, and have been to 5 of the 7 continents.
                Antarctica and Australia, you're up!
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                My passion: I LOVE sports - it's one of the most powerful tools we
                can use to teach important life skills including tenacity, teamwork
                and discipline. Anything involving sports, and I'm in - I have played,
                coached, and refereed as long as I can remember. My favortites are basketball
                and soccer.
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                Fun Fact: There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way.
                Bonus: From when it was discovered to when it was declassified as a planet, 
                Pluto did not make a full orbit around the sun.
